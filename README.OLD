1.1. INTRODUCTION
==================

  This is a simple 3D wireframe renderer designed by myself, with no other external sources
  of help except for the Turbo Pascal video library/drivers.

  Files included are:-

    3DP.EXE        - The 3D wireframe renderer software itself!

    3DPMAKER.EXE   - DOS mode 3DP object file maker to ease creation of 3D files.
                     (Still under development.)

    3DPGMAKE.EXE   - GUI version of 3DPMAKER, and with the X-Y, X-Z and Y-Z axis views.
                     Ability to use the mouse, etc. (Still under SERIOUS development!!!)

    3DPREG.EXE     - Registration key maker, which, unfortunately, only I have it. :P

    PALLETTE.EXE   - 256 color pallette listing. (Works at 800x600x256.)

    UNIVESA.EXE    - Run this file if you experience display problems.

    3DPVESA.BAT   - A file to aid running UNIVESA.EXE and 3DP.EXE.

    3DP.INI        - The configuration file for the renderer.

    LOGO.DAT       - The text logo of 3DP. (Do NOT delete!)

    REG.DAT        - Registration data file. If you software izn't registered, this file
                     won't exist.

    README.TXT     - THIS FILE.

    *.3DP          - 3D object data files. These are text files and can be opened and
                     edited by Windows Notepad or any other text editors. (NOTE: Do NOT
                     use *NIX editors. The way they denote a new line is different from
                     how DOS/Windows denotes it.)
      LOGO.3DP ....... 3DP's logo in 3D!
      TEST.3DP ....... Test 3D object data file. Inside this file is the instructions to
                       the santax of the 3D object data file.
      CUBE.3DP ....... Simple cube. This is to test max. performance of the software.
      AXIS.3DP ....... Learn about the 3 primary axis. Example of text also in this file.
                       It sounds abit educational tho. :P
      LIVING.3DP ..... A 3D world of a living room designed by me. =)

    *.FNT          - Font files for use in graphics mode.
      DEFAULT.FNT .... The default font for text in graphics mode. (Do NOT delete!)
      ARIAL.FNT ...... A font almost similar to the Arial font in Windows.
      BOLD.FNT ....... A boldtype font.
      COMPUTER.FNT ... The same font used in ICR for checques, etc..
      STENCIL.FNT .... A stencil-like font.


              


1.2. PLATFORMS
===============

  This program has problems in Windows NT 4.0. I have not tested Windows 2000 yet but I
  HOPE that it will work though. If any of you are using Windows 2000, please let me know
  if the program works. Remember to read the TROUBLESHOOTING section on "Funny display"
  before you start.

  Platforms that SHOULD work are:-
    * MS-DOS 6.22 and above
    * Microsoft Windows 95
    * Microsoft Windows 98
    * Any other DOS-based O/S

  IF you are using Windows NT 4.0, sad to say, you'll have to edit 3DP.INI and change
  SetVideoMode to 1 (320x240) and define centers at 160, 120. It should run really fast
  though, just that it looks crappy.




1.3. PERFORMANCE
=================

  Performance impact on the software due to resolution izn't really great, therefore I
  advise you to use the highest resolution possible so that there is ample space to move
  around.

  Using text in the object file will hinder performance greatly, so use them wisely.
  A few ways of using texts are as labels and/or notes. The text do not shrink/warp or
  turn together with your object, and they are always in a straight line of constant
  length, so it's no point making those text part of your object. They are ment to help
  in the object.

  Large 3D objects with many polygons/lines will definately slow the program down.
  Sometimes, check through your data files to find any overlapping lines, or double
  copies of the same tags. Removing a few of these might cause the software to improve
  quite abit!

  If your object is small, play around with the FPS using the PAGEUP and PAGEDOWN keys
  to get the best refresh rate.

  To view things in detail, hit "P" instead of straining your eyes at a flickering line
  at 1.8X zoom. :P

  Ultimately, it all boils down to me being able to implement page flipping or not.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. VERSION INFORMATION
=========================
  Version 2.12
    Text browser "text length exceeds window width" clipping problem fixed. Lines has
    been made to restrict within window width.
    Text browser algorithm improved - no extra redundant redrawing needed for unknown
    keys.
    Text browser window graphics improved.
    Added acknowledgement to README.TXT for the video libaries. (See section on CREDITS.)
    Included PALLETTE.EXE for users who want fancyful colours. The PALLETE.EXE will
    list the whole of the 256 color pallette in 800x600x256.
    
  Version 2.11
    HELP window looks better - with titlebar and all.
    "R" key views README.TXT (Part of the built-in text browser function.)

  Version 2.10
    Fixed bug which dosen't redraw the copyright information after the PAUSE window
    dissappears.
    Help is now working!
    Improved HELP window drawing algorithm.

  Version 2.01
    3D version of 3DP's logo! LOGO.3DP :)
    Ability to add text to 3D object file using "T <X> <Y> <Z> <Color> <Text>"

  Version 1.9
    FPS changeble via PGUP and PGDN keys. Good for trial and error FPS configurations
    for the best refresh rates. This won't help huge objects/worlds tho.

  Version 1.8
    Improved algorithm to redraw text only when necessary to increase rendering speed.
    Changed default wireframe colour. :)
    Made the "UNREGISTERED VERSION" word flashing to make it more annoying.

  Version 1.7
    Added registration ability. (Aww, for those who didn't get the earlier versions.)
    Added key input status display. (Colour change, pause, zoom, etc..)

  Version 1.6
    Added colour change function.

  Version 1.5
    Added frame pause function.

  Version 1.4
    Added Z axis rotate function.

  Version 1.3
    Added instructions page.

  Older versions
    Heh, I didn't make a documentation during the initial stages of this program, so
    they aren't tracked, but I remembered that I removed the translation function 'cos
    they serve no purpose.

    Bad programming practice eh? No program flowchart either! :P




2.2. BUGS
==========

  Clipping occurs when a line goes out of the side of the screen. This is a bug in the
  video driver itself.

  DOWN ARROW key actives the PAUSE command (Same as hitting "P".) Just lazy to add a few
  lines of code to elimate this, that's all. :P Since DOWN ARROW serves no purpose at
  this very monent, I'll let it be the extra key for the pause function.




2.3. WISH LIST
===============

  Here are some features which I (and others) who'd like to have in the software:-

  * Automatic animation 3D object file with extentions .3DA. :)
  * GUI 3D file editor/maker. (IN PROCESS!!!)
  * More windows-like look.
  * Page flipping!!!

  Thanks to all who wrote in with suggestions. :) Any more suggestions can be sent
  to me via e-mail at detach8@hotmail.com.

3. REGISTRATION
================

  Usage of this program is free for all home and office users, but it might be worth
  registering if you are going to use this for commercial presentation purposes, as it
  would also include tools to ease your 3D file creation.

  Send me US $9.90 (by checque ONLY) if you think my effort is worth being paid for, and
  also getting that darn "UNREGISTERED VERSION" word away from your 3D object. :)

3.1. LICENCES
==============

  Do note that EACH registration file goes by PER USER basis, i.e. each person using the
  registered copy of the software must own a copy of the licence to use the registered
  software. (See section 5.1 for terms and conditions of use.)

  If you need a commercial licence involving huge numbers, you can e-mail me for a request
  and I'll see about that. :)




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1. TROUBLESHOOTING - PROBLEMS
================================

  I SEE NOTHING!
    If the gets stuck after you hit ENTER, try hitting ALT+ENTER to enter full screen mode
    if you aren't already there.


  STUCK AFTER HITTING ENTER! BLANK SCREEN/MESSY SCREEN!
    If you are stuck at a blank screen in full screen mode, simply hit ESC, then hit Y to
    quit the program. You may need to turn your monitor off and on again. Reboot only at
    the last resort. Try running UNIVESA.EXE before running your program. I have included
    a batch file called 3DPVESA.BAT. You can run that file to aid you.


  FLICKERS
    If you object is huge (e.g. A room, a large sphere), you'll have no choice but to edit
    3DP.INI and change SetMaxFPS to 0 and put up with the flicker.If your object is small,
    change SetMaxFPS to somewhere around 75 or so. Use the PGUP and PGDN keys while in the
    program and find the best FPS.


  SLOW!!!
    If the program runs slowly, it may be your system configuration or the configuration of
    the file 3DP.INI. If you system is slower than 100MHz, then forget about it. If your
    system is faster than that, try finding the section on SetMaxFPS and modifying the
    values in a trial-and-error style. Version 1.9 allows using the PGUP and PGDN keys to
    control FPS dynamically. This may be quite useful too.


  OBJECT SPINS NON STOP
    You haven't installed your mouse driver yet. If you are running under full MS-DOS
    mode, remember to download the mouse driver and enable it. If you are using Windows
    9x, the mouse driver that came with windows should work.




4.2. TROUBLESHOOTING - ERRORS
==============================

  Integer divide by zero error
  Some internal calculation went b00m. An attempt to divide integer value by zero (which
  is supposed to give you the answer of infinate, but the computer returns an error) has
  occured. If you happen to set anything to zero, try changing it to 1.

  Runtime error
  Copy down the last few lines which was displayed before the runtime error occured, then
  send me an e-mail, pasting the last 5 to 8 lines before the error appeared inside the
  mail. If you accidentally deleted any file, or you edited any of the original files,
  try downloading the software again, or checking your file for errors. (Usually the
  3D object file.)

  Overflows
  It is either your O/S is unstable, you have not enough memory, your object file is too
  big, or my program has a bug. Just send me an e-mail and some information about how the
  error appeared, how to produce it, the last few lines of text on the screen, etc..


  Thanks to all who give me feedback. For my e-mail, refer to section 6.
