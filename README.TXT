README.TXT for 3DP 2.12

3DP is now released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Please refer to http://www.gnu.org for more information on GPL.

Full source codes and compiled program binaries for MS-DOS or
compatibles are provide within this package.

Please read README.OLD (using Notepad or something equivalent to
a text editor) if you need any help. It might have some information
on problems you encounterd.

This program might not work on Non-Windows and Windows NT based
kernel operating systems such as Windows 2000. I have personally
got it to work with Win2k but produced some erratic results.

To run on Windows NT/2000, first run 3DP.EXE and then switch to
full screen mode by hitting ALT+ENTER, then press the ENTER key
as instructed on-screen.

Running it on Windows NT/2000 It MIGHT crash your operating system,
so you have been forewarned.

To run, simply run 3DP.EXE from inside Windows 95/98/Me or DOS.

If you need to change some configurations, edit 3DP.INI.

If you get an irritating UNREGISTERED VERSION message, simply run
3DPREG.EXE and generate a registration file.

As this program is almost obselete, I will not provide any form
of support for it. Please self-help with the source codes (*.PAS)
written in Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0.

I can be reached via e-mail at <detach8@hotmail.com> for any other
queries except support questions.
